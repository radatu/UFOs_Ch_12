## UFO Sightings Analysis
### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, users can filter sightings by city, state, country, and shape.

### Results
To perform a search, the user can enter the desired date, city, state, country, and/or shape in the corresponding input fields. After entering the desired values, the user can press enter to display the filtered results. A screenshot of the filter search is shown below:

The table updates automatically, displaying the filtered results, as shown below:

### Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that the data is limited to a specific time period and may not include recent UFO sightings. To improve the webpage, it would be beneficial to regularly update the data and include a larger range of dates.

Two recommendations for further development are:

Add a map visualization to display the location of each sighting on a map.
Incorporate machine learning algorithms to automatically classify the shape of the sightings.
With these improvements, the UFO sightings analysis can be enhanced and provide a better user experience.
